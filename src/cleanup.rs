//! Cleaning up signals.
//!
//! The routines in this module allow resetting the signals of an application back to defaults.
//! This is intended for the following situation:
//!
//! * A terminal signal (eg. a `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` or something similar) is received.
//! * The application resets the signal handlers to defaults.
//! * The application proceeds to perform some kind of shutdown (saving data, cleaning up, ...).
//! * If another such signal is received, the application is terminated right away the hard way,
//!   without finishing the shutdown.
//!
//! The alternative of leaving the original signals in place might be problematic in case the
//! shutdown takes a long time or when it gets stuck. In such case the application would appear to
//! ignore the signal and just refuse to die.
//!
//! There are two ways to perform the reset:
//! * Registering the reset as part of the signal handlers. This is more reliable (even in case the
//!   application is already stuck in some kind of infinite loop, it would still work). This is
//!   done by [register].
//! * Manually resetting the handlers just before the shutdown. This is done with [cleanup_signal].

/// # Warning

/// have succeeded).
///
/// This behaviour **can change** in future versions without considering it a breaking change.
///
/// In other words, this is expected to be called only before terminating the application and no
/// further manipulation of the given signal is supported in any way. While it won't cause UB, it
/// *will* produce unexpected results.

/// This resets the signal to the OS default. It doesn't revert to calling any previous signal
/// handlers (the ones not handled by `signal-hook`). All the hooks registered for this signal are
/// removed.
///
/// The intended use case is making sure further instances of a terminal signal have immediate
/// effect. If eg. a CTRL+C is pressed, the application removes all signal handling and proceeds to
/// its own shutdown phase. If the shutdown phase takes too long or gets stuck, the user may press
/// CTRL+C again which will then kill the application immediately, by a default signal action.
///
/// # Warning
///
/// This action is *global* (affecting hooks some other library or unrelated part of program
/// registered) and *irreversible*. Once called, registering new hooks for this signal has no
/// further effect (they'll appear to be registered, but they won't be called by the signal). The
/// latter may change in the future and it won't be considered a breaking change.
///
/// In other words, this is expected to be called only once the application enters its terminal
/// state and is not supported otherwise.

/// reset the signal directly from inside the signal handler itself.

/// The reset as part of the action is *global* and *irreversible*. All signal hooks and all
