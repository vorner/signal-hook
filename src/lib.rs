//! Library for easier and safe Unix signal handling
//!
//! Unix signals are inherently hard to handle correctly, for several reasons:
//!
//! * They are a global resource. If a library wants to set its own signal handlers, it risks
//!   disturbing some other library. It is possible to chain the previous signal handler, but then
//!   it is impossible to remove the old signal handlers from the chains in any practical manner.
//! * They can be called from whatever thread, requiring synchronization. Also, as they can
//!   interrupt a thread at any time, making most handling race-prone.
//! * According to the POSIX standard, the set of functions one may call inside a signal handler is
//!   limited to very few of them. To highlight, mutexes (or other locking mechanisms) and memory
//!   allocation and deallocation is *not* allowed.
//!
//! This library aims to solve some of the problems. It provides a global registry of actions
//! performed on arrival of signals. It is possible to register multiple actions for the same
//! signal and it is possible to remove the actions later on. If there was a previous signal
//! handler when the first action for a signal is registered, it is chained (but the original one
//! can't be removed).
//!
//! The main function of the library is [`register`](fn.register.html).
//!
//! It also offers several common actions one might want to register, implemented in the correct
//! way. They are scattered through submodules and have the same limitations and characteristics as
//! the [`register`](fn.register.html) function. Generally, they work to postpone the action taken
//! outside of the signal handler, where the full freedom and power of rust is available.
//!
//! Unlike other Rust libraries for signal handling, this should be flexible enough to handle all
//! the common and useful patterns.
//!
//! The library avoids all the newer fancy signal-handling routines. These generally have two
//! downsides:
//!
//! * They are not fully portable, therefore the library would have to contain *both* the
//!   implementation using the basic routines and the fancy ones. As signal handling is not on the
//!   hot path of moth programs, this would not bring any actual benefit.
//! * The other routines require that the given signal is masked in all application's threads. As
//!   the signals are not masked by default and a new thread inherits the signal mask of its
//!   parent, it is possible to guarantee such global mask by masking them before any threads
//!   start. While this is possible for an application developer to do, it is not possible for a
//!   a library.
//!
//! # Warning
//!
//! Even with this library, you should thread with care. It does not eliminate all the problems
//! mentioned above.
//!
//! Also, note that the OS may collate multiple instances of the same signal into just one call of
//! the signal handler. Furthermore, some abstractions implemented here also naturally collate
//! multiple instances of the same signal. The general guarantee is, if there was at least one
//! signal of the given number delivered, an action will be taken, but it is not specified how many
//! times ‒ signals work mostly as kind of „wake up now“ nudge, if the application is slow to wake
//! up, it may be nudged multiple times before it does so.
//!
//! # Signal limitations
//!
//! OS limits still apply ‒ it is not possible to redefine certain signals (eg. `SIGKILL` or
//! `SIGSTOP`) and it is probably a *very* stupid idea to touch certain other ones (`SIGSEGV`,
//! `SIGFPE`, `SIGILL`). Therefore, this library will panic if any attempt at manipulating these is
//! made. There are some use cases for redefining the latter ones, but these are not well served by
//! this library and you really *really* have to know what you're doing and are generally on your
//! own doing that.
//!
//! # Signal masks
//!
//! As the library uses `sigaction` under the hood, signal masking works as expected (eg. with
//! `pthread_sigmask`). This means, signals will *not* be delivered if the signal is masked in all
//! program's threads.
//!
//! By the way, if you do want to modify the signal mask (or do other Unix-specific magic), the
//! [nix](https://crates.io/crates/nix) crate offers safe interface to many low-level functions,
//! including
//! [`pthread_sigmask`](https://docs.rs/nix/0.11.0/nix/sys/signal/fn.pthread_sigmask.html).
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! It should work on any POSIX.1-2001 system, which are all the major big OSes with the notable
//! exception of Windows.
//!
//! Windows has some limited support for signals, patches to include support in this library are
//! welcome.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate libc;
//! extern crate signal_hook;
//!
//! use std::io::Error;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let term = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
//!     signal_hook::flag::register(libc::SIGTERM, Arc::clone(&term))?;
//!     while !term.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
//!         // Do some time-limited stuff here
//!         // (if this could block forever, then there's no guarantee the signal will have any
//!         // effect).
//! #
//! #       // Hack to terminate the example, not part of the real code.
//! #       term.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * `mio-support`: The [`Signals` iterator](iterator/struct.Signals.html) becomes pluggable into
//!   mio.
//! * `tokio-support`: The [`Signals`](iterator/struct.Signals.html) can be turned into
//!   [`Async`](iterator/struct.Async.html), which provides a `Stream` interface for integration in
//!   the asynchronous world.

// # Internal workings
//
// This uses a form of RCU. There's an atomic pointer to the current action descriptors (in the
// form of ArcSwap, to be able to track what, if any, signal handlers still use the version). A
// signal handler takes a copy of the pointer and calls all the relevant actions.
//
// Modifications to that are protected by a mutex, to avoid juggling multiple signal handlers at
// once (eg. not calling sigaction concurrently). This should not be a problem, because modifying
// the signal actions should be initialization only anyway. To avoid all allocations and also
// deallocations inside the signal handler, after replacing the pointer, the modification routine
// needs to busy-wait for the reference count on the old pointer to drop to 1 and take ownership ‒
// that way the one deallocating is the modification routine, outside of the signal handler.

///
/// The first two are not possible to override (and the underlying C functions simply ignore all

/// very special handling to do so correctly (direct manipulation of the application's address
/// space, `longjmp` and similar). Unless you know very well what you're doing, you'll shoot
/// yourself into the foot and this library won't help you with that.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Since the library manipulates signals using the low-level C functions, all these can return
/// errors. Generally, the errors mean something like the specified signal does not exist on the
/// given platform ‒ ofter a program is debugged and tested on a given OS, it should never return
/// an error.
///
/// However, if an error *is* returned, there are no guarantees if the given action was registered.
///
/// # Unsafety
///
/// This function is unsafe, because the `action` is run inside a signal handler. The set of
/// functions allowed to be called from within is very limited (they are called signal-safe
/// functions by POSIX). These specifically do *not* contain mutexes and memory
/// allocation/deallocation. They *do* contain routines to terminate the program, to further
/// manipulate signals (by the low-level functions, not by this library) and to read and write file
/// descriptors. Calling program's own functions consisting only of these is OK, as is manipulating
/// program's variables ‒ however, as the action can be called on any thread that does not have the
/// given signal masked (by default no signal is masked on any thread), and mutexes are a no-go,
/// this is harder than it looks like at first.
///
/// As panicking from within a signal handler would be a panic across FFI boundary (which is
/// undefined behavior), the passed handler must not panic.
///
/// If you find these limitations hard to satisfy, choose from the helper functions in submodules
/// of this library ‒ these provide safe interface to use some common signal handling patters.
///
/// # Race condition
///
/// Currently, there's a short race condition. If this is the first action for the given signal,
/// there was another signal handler previously and the signal comes into a different thread during
/// this function, it can happen the original handler is not chained in this one instance.
///
/// This is considered unimportant problem, since most programs install their signal handlers
/// during startup, before the signals effectively do anything. If you want to avoid the race
/// condition completely, initialize all signal handling before starting any threads.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Even when it is possible to repeatedly install and remove actions during the lifetime of a
/// program, the installation and removal is considered a slow operation and should not be done
/// very often. Also, there's limited (though huge) amount of distinct IDs (they are `u64`).
