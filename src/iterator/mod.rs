/// Unlike the helpers in other modules, this registers the signals when created and unregisters
/// them on drop. It provides the pending signals during its lifetime, either in batches or as an
/// infinite iterator.
///
/// # Multiple threads
///
/// Instances of this struct can be [sent][std::marker::Send] to other threads. In a multithreaded
/// application this can be used to dedicate a separate thread for signal handling. In this case
/// you should get a [`Handle`] using the [`handle`][Signals::handle] method before sending the
/// `Signals` instance to a background thread. With the handle you will be able to shut down the
/// background thread later.
///
/// The controller handle can be shared between as many threads as you like using its
/// [`clone`][Handle::clone] method.
