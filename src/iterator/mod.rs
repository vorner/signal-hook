//! An iterator over incoming signals.
//!
//! This provides a higher abstraction over the signals, providing
//! the [`SignalsInfo`] structure which is able to iterate over the
//! incoming signals. The structure is parametrized by an
//! [`Exfiltrator`][self::exfiltrator::Exfiltrator], which specifies what information is returned
//! for each delivered signal. Note that some exfiltrators are behind a feature flag.
//!
//! The [`Signals`] is a type alias for the common case when it is enough to get the signal number.
//!
//! This module (and everything in it) is turned by the `iterator` feature. It is **on** by
//! default, the possibility to turn off is mostly possible for very special purposes (compiling on
//! `<rustc-1.36`, minimizing the amount of code compiled, …). In a sense, this is the highest
//! level abstraction of the crate and the API expected to be used by most of the people.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate libc;
//! extern crate signal_hook;
//!
//! use std::io::Error;
//!
//! use signal_hook::consts::signal::*;
//! use signal_hook::iterator::Signals;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
//!     let mut signals = Signals::new(&[
//!         SIGHUP,
//!         SIGTERM,
//!         SIGINT,
//!         SIGQUIT,
//! #       SIGUSR1,
//!     ])?;
//! #   // A trick to terminate the example when run as doc-test. Not part of the real code.
//! #   signal_hook::low_level::raise(SIGUSR1).unwrap();
//!     'outer: loop {
//!         // Pick up signals that arrived since last time
//!         for signal in signals.pending() {
//!             match signal as libc::c_int {
//!                 SIGHUP => {
//!                     // Reload configuration
//!                     // Reopen the log file
//!                 }
//!                 SIGTERM | SIGINT | SIGQUIT => {
//!                     break 'outer;
//!                 },
//! #               SIGUSR1 => return Ok(()),
//!                 _ => unreachable!(),
//!             }
//!         }
//!         // Do some bit of work ‒ something with upper limit on waiting, so we don't block
//!         // forever with a SIGTERM already waiting.
//!     }
//!     println!("Terminating. Bye bye");

/// The main structure of the module, representing interest in some signals.
///
/// Unlike the helpers in other modules, this registers the signals when created and unregisters
/// them on drop. It provides the pending signals during its lifetime, either in batches or as an
/// infinite iterator.
///
/// Most users will want to use it through the [`Signals`] type alias for simplicity.
///
/// # Multiple threads
///
/// Instances of this struct can be [sent][std::marker::Send] to other threads. In a multithreaded
/// application this can be used to dedicate a separate thread for signal handling. In this case
/// you should get a [`Handle`] using the [`handle`][Signals::handle] method before sending the
/// `Signals` instance to a background thread. With the handle you will be able to shut down the
/// background thread later, or to operatively add more signals.
///
/// The controller handle can be shared between as many threads as you like using its
/// [`clone`][Handle::clone] method.
///

///
/// The [`SignalOnly`] provides only the signal number. There are further exfiltrators available in
/// the [`exfiltrator`] module. Note that some of them are behind feature flags that need to be
/// enabled.
