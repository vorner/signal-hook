//! Backend of the [signal-hook] crate.
//!
//! The [signal-hook] crate tries to provide an API to the unix signals, which are a global
//! resource. Therefore, it is desirable an application contains just one version of the crate
//! which manages this global resource. But that makes it impossible to make breaking changes in
//! the API.
//!
//! Therefore, this crate provides very minimal and low level API to the signals that is unlikely
//! to have to change, while there may be multiple versions of the [signal-hook] that all use this
//! low-level API to provide different versions of the high level APIs.
//!
//! It is also possible some other crates might want to build a completely different API. This
//! split allows these crates to still reuse the same low-level routines in this crate instead of
//! going to the (much more dangerous) unix calls.
//!
//! # What this crate provides
//!
//! The only thing this crate does is multiplexing the signals. An application or library can add
//! or remove callbacks and have multiple callbacks for the same signal.
//!
//! It handles dispatching the callbacks and managing them in a way that uses only the
//! [async-signal-safe] functions inside the signal handler. Note that the callbacks are still run
//! inside the signal handler, so it is up to the caller to ensure they are also
//! [async-signal-safe].
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! This is a building block for other libraries creating reasonable abstractions on top of
//! signals. The [signal-hook] is the generally preferred way if you need to handle signals in your
//! application and provides several safe patterns of doing so.
//!
//! # Rust version compatibility
//!
//! Currently builds on 1.26.0 an newer and this is very unlikely to change. However, tests
//! require dependencies that don't build there, so tests need newer Rust version (they are run on
//! stable).
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! This crate includes a limited support for Windows, based on `signal`/`raise` in the CRT.
//! There are differences in both API and behavior:
//!
//! - Due to lack of `siginfo_t`, we don't provide `register_sigaction` or `register_unchecked`.
//! - Due to lack of signal blocking, there's a race condition.
//!   After the call to `signal`, there's a moment where we miss a signal.
//!   That means when you register a handler, there may be a signal which invokes
//!   neither the default handler or the handler you register.
//! - Handlers registered by `signal` in Windows are cleared on first signal.
//!   To match behavior in other platforms, we re-register the handler each time the handler is
//!   called, but there's a moment where we miss a handler.
//!   That means when you receive two signals in a row, there may be a signal which invokes
//!   the default handler, nevertheless you certainly have registered the handler.

//
// This uses a form of RCU. There's an atomic pointer to the current action descriptors (in the
// form of IndependentArcSwap, to be able to track what, if any, signal handlers still use the
// version). A signal handler takes a copy of the pointer and calls all the relevant actions.
//
// Modifications to that are protected by a mutex, to avoid juggling multiple signal handlers at
// once (eg. not calling sigaction concurrently). This should not be a problem, because modifying
// the signal actions should be initialization only anyway. To avoid all allocations and also
// deallocations inside the signal handler, after replacing the pointer, the modification routine
// needs to busy-wait for the reference count on the old pointer to drop to 1 and take ownership ‒
// that way the one deallocating is the modification routine, outside of the signal handler.

/// generally needs very special handling to do so correctly (direct manipulation of the
/// application's address space, `longjmp` and similar). Unless you know very well what you're
/// doing, you'll shoot yourself into the foot and this library won't help you with that.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Since the library manipulates signals using the low-level C functions, all these can return
/// errors. Generally, the errors mean something like the specified signal does not exist on the
/// given platform ‒ ofter a program is debugged and tested on a given OS, it should never return
/// an error.
///
/// However, if an error *is* returned, there are no guarantees if the given action was registered
/// or not.
///
/// # Unsafety
///
/// This function is unsafe, because the `action` is run inside a signal handler. The set of
/// functions allowed to be called from within is very limited (they are called signal-safe
/// functions by POSIX). These specifically do *not* contain mutexes and memory
/// allocation/deallocation. They *do* contain routines to terminate the program, to further
/// manipulate signals (by the low-level functions, not by this library) and to read and write file
/// descriptors. Calling program's own functions consisting only of these is OK, as is manipulating
/// program's variables ‒ however, as the action can be called on any thread that does not have the
/// given signal masked (by default no signal is masked on any thread), and mutexes are a no-go,
/// this is harder than it looks like at first.
///
/// As panicking from within a signal handler would be a panic across FFI boundary (which is
/// undefined behavior), the passed handler must not panic.
///
/// If you find these limitations hard to satisfy, choose from the helper functions in submodules
/// of this library ‒ these provide safe interface to use some common signal handling patters.
///
/// # Race condition
///
/// Currently, there's a short race condition. If this is the first action for the given signal,
/// there was another signal handler previously and the signal comes into a different thread during
/// this function, it can happen the original handler is not chained in this one instance.
///
/// This is considered unimportant problem, since most programs install their signal handlers
/// during startup, before the signals effectively do anything. If you want to avoid the race
/// condition completely, initialize all signal handling before starting any threads.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Even when it is possible to repeatedly install and remove actions during the lifetime of a
/// program, the installation and removal is considered a slow operation and should not be done
/// very often. Also, there's limited (though huge) amount of distinct IDs (they are `u64`).
